description: 'Hal Higdon: Advanced 1: "This training program for Advanced 1 marathoners
  offers a progressive buildup--similar to that for the novice and intermediate runners,
  except you start at 10 miles and peak with three 20-milers. There is also more training
  at marathon pace (usually Saturdays, the day before Sunday long runs). The major
  difference, however, is the addition of speedwork. Advanced 1 has one day of speedwork;
  Advanced 2, two. Pick your poison." (more details at the link below)'
